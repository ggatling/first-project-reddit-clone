1. Our Reddit project was built using HTML5, CSS, JS and Bootstrap 4. Bootstrap is a popular CSS framework for developing responsive web and mobile projects.


2. We began our Reddit Clone by brain storming the layout. The layout started as a simple drawing on a white board. After few sketches of the layout we both agreed on the third one we sketched. To continue this project we asked probing questions including how many pages we planned to have, what colors are we going to use for the design, what frameworks can we use to build the clone and how are we going to incorporate the functionality into the design. Our initial discussions included ideas surrounding a multi page design but in order to have a better UI experience for the user we limited our project to a single webpage and. The single page design is responsive and user friendly. 

3. Unsolved issues that we faced:
  - Bringing in the user profile so we could see it and add the corresponding updates
  - Allowing the user to only view their posts/comments
  - Viewing/creating comments
